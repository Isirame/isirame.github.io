My research has centered on motor control improvement in subjects with impairments of the motor control system. This work ranges over many areas of knowledge including in (i.) the identification and classification of movement, (ii.) design and construction of exoskeletons that rehabilitate movement, (iii.) transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation, (iv.) human movement experimentation. I thus have competencies in machine design, programming, data analysis and mechatronics. Please check out my projects to see how I have applied these.
