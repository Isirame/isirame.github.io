My hybrid background in computer science and sociology has proven to be
an invaluable asset for studying digitally mediated human interactions.
Now I want to share that knowledge with aspiring communicators and scientists.

As a PhD candidate at Columbia University and formerly a researcher at the MIT Media Lab,
I have investigated the role of social media in the rise of new cultural paradigms.
That still constitutes an important part of my research agenda.

In these pages, you will find an outline of my many lives as a [scholar](researcher),
a [developer](developer), an [educator](educator), and a [reporter](journalist). 
The interplay of communication and technology is
the common thread running through all those experiences.
