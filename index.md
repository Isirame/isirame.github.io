Welcome! I'm excited to share my journey as an engineer, where creative problem-solving has always come naturally to me and has driven my passion for learning and innovation. Throughout my academic journey, culminating in a PhD in Mechanical Engineering, I have gained extensive experience in machine design, control engineering, mechanics, robotics, and more.  

My PhD research focused on developing exoskeletons for rehabilitation, specifically targeting individuals with motor impairments, and analyzing gait and posture. One of my key achievements was designing and constructing the Robotic Upright Stand Trainer, a cable-driven exoskeleton. This device featured two end effectors: one controlled in the 2D horizontal plane by four motors, and the other in 3D by eight motors. Equipped with a sophisticated control system, the trainer could sense the movements of spinal cord injury (SCI) patients undergoing postural control rehabilitation and either support or perturb them as needed. This innovation significantly reduced the workload of physical therapists involved in patient rehabilitation.

Another significant aspect of my research was exploring Transcutaneous Spinal Cord Stimulation (TSCS) as a non-invasive method to enhance neuroplasticity in SCI patients. While surgically implanted epidural stimulation has shown promising results in restoring muscle control and even enabling some SCI patients to walk independently, my work focused on TSCS as a non-invasive alternative. I investigated its potential to increase muscle activation in healthy individuals and its effectiveness when combined with balance control tasks.

Currently, as a post-doctoral research scientist, I am further enhancing the Robotic Stand Trainer's capabilities by adding features such as impedance control and coordinating trunk and pelvis movement using a neural network model based on the movement patterns of healthy individuals.
