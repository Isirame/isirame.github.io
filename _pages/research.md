## Robotic Exoskeleton for Postural Control Training of Spinal Cord Injury Patients

Postural control training is important in training spinal cord injury (SCI) patients to recover standing balance. Along, with a group of colleagues, I developed an exoskeleton for this stand training that reduces the strain on physical therapists conducting the training.

The exoskeleton was called the Robotic Stand Trainer (RObUST), is cable-driven, and uses two belts worn around the trunk and pelvis of the patients for actuation.
