## Robotic Exoskeleton for Postural Control Training of Spinal Cord Injury Patients

The Robotic Stand Trainer (RObUST) is a cable-driven robotic exoskeleton for postural control training of spinal cord injury patients. It is a 14 motor, four actuator system that can provide planar control on a subject's trunk, 6 degree-of-freedom control on their pelvis, and pull forces on each knee.

With a group of colleagues at the ROAR Lab, I designed, and built this device along with its software control system.

## Transcutaneous Spinal Cord Stimulation
Transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation is a non-invasive analog to epidural stimulation which has the potential to activate neuronal circuitry below a spinal cord injury lesion, circuits which remain intact but can no longer efficiently receive supraspinal input. I led the investigation of the use of TSCS at the ROAR Lab, concluding in [studies](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/wearable-technologies/article/effect-of-transcutaneous-spinal-cord-stimulation-on-the-balance-and-neurophysiological-characteristics-of-young-healthy-adults/23F07B0A79BF95F29F0A030FC8B489AC) that showed that electrical stimulation increases muscle activation during functional tasks in healthy subjects.

We measured H-Reflexs:
